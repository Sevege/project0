        <h1>Project Zero</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>The main objective of this project is to allow you to
            become familiar with the GitHub+Eclipse workflow you'll be
            using on later projects. It will also give you a little bit
            of practice writing code in Eclipse, and also get you
		started reading the Java API.</p>

	<p>To start, make sure you've joined your "team" on GitHub (if you didn't get an automatic email about this, try logging into github, then visiting https://github.com/BC-CISC3120-S17). Once you've joined the team, go to the team page, and you shoud see a repository with <code>project0</code> in
	its name. Copy the URL of the repository,
	then <strong>clone</strong> it into your Eclipse workspace:
	this should basically create a new project with a very bare-bones <code>ProjectZero.java</code> file. Your task is to complete this program so that it runs in accordance with the specifications below. You should <strong>commit</strong> your code frequently, and <strong>push</strong> your commits at the end of each work session (if not more frequently).</p>

        <h2>The Project</h2>


        <p>
            In the application activities, we've used 
            <code>Scanner</code>
            objects to read input from the keyboard. For this project,
            we'll use <code>
              Scanner
            </code> to do an apparently simple thing: read in two
            numbers, then compute and print their sum. A run of your
            program would look something like this  (user's text in <font
                color="red">red</font>):</p>

<pre>
Enter two numbers: <font color="red">4 5</font>
The sum of 4 and 5 is 9.
</pre>

<p>           However, there is one
            small twist: your program should let the user <em>silently</em> decide whether to enter
            numbers as integers or floating-point numbers (eg as
            <code>int</code>
            or as
            <code>double</code>
            ). Calculate the sum depending on the type of the user's
            entry. So your program should also run like this:
        </p>
        
<pre>
Enter two numbers: <font color="red">4.2 5.45</font>
The sum of 4.2 and 5.45 is 9.65.
</pre>

<p>Of course, your program should be able to deal with "mixed types":</p>

<pre>
Enter two numbers: <font color="red">5 17.3</font>
The sum of 5 and 17.3 is 22.3.
</pre>

        <p>
            Note that you should <em>not</em> ask the user what type
            they're going to use&mdash; your input/output should be as
            simple as the sample runs above.</p>
        <p>
            You should also deal gracefully (no ugly error/exception 
            messages!) with the situation in which the user's input is
            not numerical. The <code>Scanner</code> class contains all the methods you need to do this easily.
        </p>

        <h2>Grading and Deadlines</h2>
<p>	Normally, I grade projects based on documentation, style,
        design, and correctness. (We'll talk more about this in class.)
        This is just a "starter," so the main emphasis is getting <em>something</em>
        done. Specifically:</p>

        <p>I will grade out of 100 points, allocated as follows:</p>

        <ol>
            
                <p>
                    <li><b>50% Completion</b> Even if you have
                        trouble getting this to work, or generating all
                        the documentation, push <em>something</em> up to
                        GitHub before the project is due. If you have
                        trouble doing this, let me know <strong>as
                            soon as possible</strong>.
                             </li>
                </p>
           
            <p>
                <li><b>25% Documentation</b>. Your project should include
                three kinds of documentation, as described in the <a
                    href="http://bc-cisc3120-f16.github.io/documentation.html">About
                    Documentation</a> page. You should provide doccomments
                for each class and method in your project, and generate
                HTML documentation using javadoc. For this project, the
                <code>README</code>
                needs only to contain a "Works Cited" section: Any
                website, book, or similar resource from which you get
                useful guidance must be listed here, along with a brief
                description of what you got from it (a bit of code? an
                explanation? an answer to a question?). You do not need
                to list the Java API or either of the two books
                required/recommended for class. If you use no other
                resources, then your "Works Cited" section must simply
                contain the word <em>None</em>.</li>
            </p>
            
            <p><li>
                    <b>25% Correctness</b> Does your program work as it
                    should?
                </p></li>

        </ol>

 <p>
            On this project, and probably all projects this semester,  you are to work strictly
            <em>on your own</em>. Specifically, you may neither show
            your code to, nor look at the code of, anyone else taking
            3120 this semester. You may consult online/textbook
            resources (subject to the "Documentation" requirements
            above). You may certainly consult with me. You may, if you
            like, discuss your design at a high level with other
            students ("Oh, I found the
            <code>java.foo.bar</code>
            package to be really helpful," or, "Sure, I can explain the
            geometry of a paint window to you.").</p>

        <p>The project is due at 11:59pm on the day of Class 9. At that time, I will clone your github repository (specifically, the 
<code>master</code> branch). Make sure all your code, documentation, etc., is current on github at that time.
          </p>

        <h3>A Note on Style</h3>

        Usually, part of your grade depends on the <em>style</em> of
        your code. Here's what I expect: Your code should be properly
        formatted, with enough (but not too much) whitespace. Eclipse
        will do most of this for you; make sure you let it help you.
        Variable names, metohd names, etc, should all be
        "self-documenting" but not excessively long (one-letter
        variables names should <em>only</em> be used as loop counters).
        <em>Generally</em>, you can use any style you like, as long as
        you're consistent. If you're not sure what style to use, follow
        the <a
            href="https://github.com/twitter/commons/blob/master/src/java/com/twitter/common/styleguide.md">GitHub 
            Style Guide</a>, except where Eclipse's automatic formatting
        contradicts these guidelines.
        </li>

        <p>
            You can earn up to 10 points extra credit by implementing
            extra behaviors. Any extra behaviors you provide should be
            listed briefly in the
            <code>README.md</code>
        </p>
